# NCL App

Flutter project to display minor details of an NCL cruise ship.

## Getting Started

Things to add if more time:
1. Check connectivity
2. Testing (Unit, Widget & Integrtation)
3. Caching the API data

Notes:
1. Went with colors and fonts harvested from Regents website since that is the team I'll be working with
2. State Management: Riverpod
3. Used VS Code Extension JSON to Dart Model for the first time to quickly build data model based on JSON provided from API
4. very_good_analysis linter was used
